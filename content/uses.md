## Hall of Shame:

**As OS, I am daily driving Windows 11.** 

*This is because of my company currently developing a windows only software for a client. We don't yet have resources to make it cross-platform, client is not interested in this, therefore I can't develop it on Linux.* 

*Despite this, I've done my best to tweak it and remove trackers, etc. I hate it, but gotta bear for some time*

**As mobile phone, I'm using Pixel 7 - intentionally.**

*Now, I have better excuse for this one, hehe! Next year I am going to install [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) to this phone. (they only support Pixel devices, as it has more hardware capability for a better security)*

**Google Photos** -  NOT ANY MORE!!

*Well, first it was built-int option for me, on my all Android phones. But then, as soon as Proton released mobile app for their Drive solution, I switched to it, and upgraded my plan. Proud moments :')*



[^dual-booted]: Yes :( , I have to, because of work reasons. But it is temporary. I have been daily driving linux (distro-hopping along the way) for 3 to 4 years, but lately, I'm forced to use [Windows](#hall-of-shame).
[^why-mint]: I have tried too many distribution. For real. Linux Mint has been the most stable, solid, just-works distro for me. I love it, its simplicity.
