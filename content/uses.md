## Hall of Shame:

### As OS, I am daily driving Windows 11
This is because of my company currently developing a windows only software for a client. We don't yet have resources to make it cross-platform, client is not interested in this, therefore I can't develop it on Linux.

Despite this, I've done my best to tweak it and remove trackers, etc. I hate it, but gotta bear for some time.

### As mobile phone, I'm using Pixel 7 - Running Graphene OS now!!
On 16 December, 2023, I finally switched to GrapheneOS. Huge thanks to everyone who had contributed to this project in one way or another.

*(old) Now, I have better excuse for this one, hehe! Next year I am going to install [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) to this phone. (they only support Pixel devices, as it has more hardware capability for a better security)*

**Google Photos** -  NOT ANY MORE!!

Using ProtonDrive now. hehe!

*(old) Well, first it was built-int option for me, on my all Android phones. But then, as soon as Proton released mobile app for their Drive solution, I switched to it, and upgraded my plan. Proud moments :')*

[^dual-booted]: Yes :( , I have to, because of work reasons. But it is temporary. I have been daily driving linux (distro-hopping along the way) for 3 to 4 years, but lately, I'm forced to use [Windows](#hall-of-shame).
