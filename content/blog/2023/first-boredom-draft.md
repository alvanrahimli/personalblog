Hey! Glad to see you here.

If you have been following my [garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), you probably know that I am on vacation and it has been going nice. It thankfully, still, is going well - we have visited some of the relatives and our now-ruin house at village. 

It is an old house with quite a bit of yard (I don't know the size, but probably is around 5 acres), built in 1960s (not sure on the year) by my granddad and his brother. They had been living there till 2006, as far as I know, for more than 40 years. 

Unfortunately, since 2006 no one is living there, and we haven't yet renovated that place. Therefore, the house is falling apart. It is in a dangerous state now, we are afraid to even go into it to just observe. 

But the place is golden. We love that garden - it feels nostalgic and our own. I would love to some day renovate that place and stay there. The weather is **amazing**.

Yes, so, as you have, most probably, already noticed, this post doesn't have any theme. This is because I saw this technique on one of [Kev Quirk's posts](https://kevquirk.com/the-blank-box). Just like him, this time I didn't have anything on my mind, so, I opened my text editor and started typing stuff. 

Also, I think I have mentioned this in previous posts - I am considering writing smaller but more frequent posts.

This actually works great with "digital garden" analogy. The choices are obvious. 

1. Would you like to plant a lot of smaller and easier flowers, or a few, but bigger plants?

For me and the purpose of this website, I am planning to go with easier - frequent posts. It feels less corporative - and more personalized. Afterall, this is kind of a replacement of social media for me, and you don't write huge novels on various topics
