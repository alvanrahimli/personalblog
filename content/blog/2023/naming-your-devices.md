Hi There!

This will be a short one, I'm working on another post, which I'm planning to publish oncoming days.

Couple of months ago, I installed Windows because of the work reasons. First I thought *"Okay, I'll just keep this simple and bare minimum, won't customize to match my needs"*, etc. However, while installing the OS, it asked my to write a name for my PC, and I said ofc, I'll change. "DESKTOP-SOMENUMS" is ugly af. So, now I had very hard choice to do. "What to call it?". 

Also, if you have been coding for some time, you most probably can relate to this. It is the naming that we are always stuck on. 

Anyways, I had some thoughts in my head:

- The name should reflect this is a windows pc. 
- Should be cute, I won't call my baby WindowsPC or smth.

So, the name I came up with was "Windy" :3. 

- It is cute.
- I also hate windy weather => it relates to me hating Windows too.
- It contains part of the word "windows", so easy to remember.

This was a great naming. Then something special happened!

I realized that I had emotional bond with my PC now - after naming it nicely. I started setting it up, removing bloatware, tidying it up, and etc. I even had nicely set-up taskbar and stuff.

This was quite interesting behavior from me. To be honest, I always had this bond to my PC, but to this degree, it was unusual and felt great. To make my mind, before writing this weblog ([mmhm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)) I googled this a bit and it turns out, there really is something special about naming stuff. You don't see people naming their domestic animals, if they are going to eat them one day. Naming enforces some kind of ownership, attachment, that forms our feelings about that thing. That is why we name our kids, pets, and even devices ðŸ˜Š. 

Anyways, at that time I decided to call my devices as weather conditions. So far I have my 

- "Windy" - I use for work purposes
- "Drizzly" - Daily driver, lovely plain Debian ðŸ¥°

Yep, that is all.

Have you ever named your devices? How did it feel? Please feel free to [share your opinions](/contact) with me

Thank you for reading this far.
