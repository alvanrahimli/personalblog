# The great question - WHY?
Well, to be honest I dont know exact answer, but I've some stories I tell myself.
First, this is because of the will of efficient use of keyboard. You know, I paid full price for all keys on it. Why shouldn't use them?  
The second reason is, wrist healty. As I'm planning coding as the main part of my life, of course, it shouldn't hurt me.  
At last, the true reason, of course, is +70% coolness. Not using mouse while coding, such a badass behaviour. 

# First steps
I began with installing Vim on my linux machine. Which is Manjaro (previously it was Fedora). Although Vi was already installed, I don't know difference, so I installed Vim, which stands for Vi IMproved.  
2 or 3 days passed, I didn't have enough courage and time to begin. Then I realised, I can do what is _not_ called The Soft-Transition. So, I installed Vim extension for Visual Studio Code. While installing I came accross with Tutor extension, with great UI and explanation. Such a niice extension it is. I went through first 5 tutorials. (It adds new tab to activity bar. You can continue learning any time, very easily)  
Currently, I know enough shortcuts and theory to use Vim for daily use, but it is not as fluent as traditional writing of mine, as I'm quite used to using these home, end, fn and etc. Not just these! I can't even Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V now! Can you beileve it?? - Of course you do. I said I'm learning Vim. Ok, ok, enough cringe, let's go back to topic.  

_Btw, these double spaces in markdown syntax for adding new line, I hate them!_  

# Getting used to madness
As I was going through those tutorials, I got used to hjkl navigation (I was going through caret labirints, lol!), Then came deleting. U know (or don't know) d at Normal mode. Oh, snap! (not snapcraft.io, I like how easy it is distributing packages with snapd :D)  I didn't tell you about modes. It is not difficult, There are 3 famous modes. **Normal, Insert and Visual**. Basically, in: 
- **Normal mode**: you navigate and manipulate text
- **Insert mode**: you of course, insert text
- **Visual mode**: you select text (or maybe as I know)
Okay, it was a bit off-the-rails (are there any phrase like this? let me know :D). Actually, there was some other shortcuts, such as gg, G, H, M, L which I did learn. (they help with navigating file, go to page top, file end and etc.)

# Pain (or is it?)
To understand my pain you don't need to do any extra things. Just know that I started learning Vim. All my instinct-like abilities (copying, pasting, selecting) must be changed. Damn, this is difficult enough to make man insult vim users and quit. But noo, I was linux enthusiast for about 3 years now. If there is one thing I have learnt by far, it is not giving up for every problem I face. My great friend Yalchin reminded this to me yesterday. By the way, he also has [great blog](https://yalchin.info/blog), you can use like handbook. Thanks to him.
