# Who am I?
- I'm a geek. My name is Alvan Rahimli. Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/alvanrahimli).  
- I do lots of procastination, as well as some coding.  
Actually, it is a lot of coding, but I feel I can still fit much more activities in a day, but you know, there are too much distractions.  
- So anyway, I'm a software developer, with about 2 years experience.  
- I do a lot of **C# & .NET Core** stuff, as well as some **Golang** coding. I enjoy writing websites, but not only them (as I plan shifting my career to more low level stuff :D).
