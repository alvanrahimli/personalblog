# Introduction
Hi, fellow reader!  
So, recently I was consooming a bit more articles, from other programmers and designers, and suddenly I thought why I'm not writing my own thoughts? Basically, this is good idea, for example you get a chance to look back and remember things you have done. But I was a bit uhmm, how to say, kinda shy. Suddenly, my friend at [themisir.com](https://themisir.com) also said this is a good idea. So, this is me, Alvan, doing it :D

# What was I up to?
Recently my life got a massive DLC and there are some interesting things in it. Let's break that into the pieces.  
Basically, these are:  
- New remote full-time job
- A startup project
- Another startup, where I am IT guy in team
- Some thoughts for another another startup
- University exams

As you can see, I have to be so stuck and busy all the time, but I'm not LOL. Just today, I have watched 2 animated movies: Wreck it Ralph 2 & Sing (has veery nice musics in it).  

## Full-time job
That full-time job, is such a pain in a**. No, I'm not afraid of tasks or smth. It is a bit complicated :(  

## A Startup project
Then we have the first startup. It is a mobile app, built for schools and teacher-student relationships. And actually, it's UI Design is almost complete and I'm looking for a mobile developer. You know, in my country, it is not that easy to find one. They are all just coders, coding some e-commerce app over-and-over again. You know, they would do the job, but they need money, and guess what, I don't have that much yet.  
Whatever, I'm planning of learning flutter myself, but it will take hell a lot of time. Bc I have whole back-end infrastructure on me also Management dashboard, Mobile app, blah blah blah. OK well, we'll see :)

## Another startup
Ok, that another one, excites my more that others. Unfortunately I can't tell you the details, but that is kinda IoT project of mine. Also the first one.  
There are projects which needs a lot of regulation.
