# ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER
As this is the first one in series, It will be a bit verbose, because I have to do introduction for all ongoing projects. Thanks.

# üí° Introduction
Hi, fellow reader!  
So, recently I was consooming a bit more articles, from other programmers and designers, and suddenly I thought why I'm not writing my own thoughts? Basically, this is good idea, for example you get a chance to look back and remember things you have done. But I was a bit uhmm, how to say, kinda shy. Suddenly, my friend at [themisir.com](https://themisir.com) also said this is a good idea. So, this is me, Alvan, doing it :D

# üí≠ What is on my mind?
Recently my life got a massive DLC and some very interesting things in it. Let's break that into the pieces.  
Basically, these are what I am (will be) working with on:  
- New remote full-time job
- Education oriented startup (w/brother)
- IoT oriented startup, where I am IT guy in team
- Idea that I'm working on
- University exams
- Whole curiosity of learning new cool stuff

As you can see, I have to be so stuck and busy all the time, but I'm not LOL. Just today, I have watched 2 animated movies: Wreck it Ralph 2 & Sing (has veery nice musics in it).  

## Full-time job
That full-time job, is such a pain in a**. No, I'm not afraid of tasks or smth. It is a bit complicated :(  

## Education oriented startup
Then we have the first startup. It is a mobile app, built for schools and teacher-student relationships. And actually, it's UI Design is almost complete and I'm looking for a mobile developer. You know, in my country, it is not that easy to find one. They are all just coders, coding some e-commerce app over-and-over again. You know, they would do the job, but they need money, and guess what, I don't have that much yet.  
Whatever, I'm planning of learning flutter myself, but it will take hell a lot of time. Bc I have whole back-end infrastructure on me also Management dashboard, Mobile app, blah blah blah. OK well, we'll see :)

## IoT oriented startup
Ok, that another one, excites my more that others. Unfortunately I can't tell you the details, but that is kinda IoT project of mine. Also the first one.  
There are projects which needs a lot of regulation.

## Idea that I'm working on
Oh, this project is a bit interesting and requires attention. It will solve a problem for companies and I'm thinking of selling this as an API. But still, this is on very early stage but I have a plan, that hopefully I'll follow. Will be writing more on this as project continues.

## Learning new things
For now, I want to learn more about Go.

# üë∑ What I actually did this week?
So, interesting question this is. Let's look at the GitHub activity heatmap: 

![GitHub Activity](/images/status-update-1/github-activity-14-11-2021.png "Github Activity")
\
As you can see, last week was a bit non-coding week. Am I happy? Absolutely no! Do I feel guilty? Indeed, yes! Then why the f* I'm not doing any work? Well, this is all because of that full-time job. I'm drowning in large codebase with no onboarding or whatsoever. I try to understand and use it, but it is slow. Okay, whatever, I'll handle all of these.  

Guess what is interesting! UI Design of our startup! I damn like that. This is exactly what makes me excited to work. And I'm looking forward to write posts about that project's development.

Okay, these was excuses of my laziness. I couldn't find exact things that I did this week. But next week won't be like this, I hope :D

# üéØ What I'm going to do next week?
- Do enough research and a bit coding to make first working example of that [idea](#idea-that-im-working-on)
- Decide who will work on mobile version of our [startup](#a-startup-project)
- Write actual code for this [startup](#a-startup-project)
- Wait for other elements to continue working on this [project](#another-startup)
- Watch some Disney movies (Idk what are these called. Pixar movies? just movies? Whatever.)
