# Welcome to my blog!

Hi there! I am Alvan, 21, software engineer and a foss fanboy.

I usually hang out at Mastodon: [@alvanrahimli@noc.social](https://noc.social/@alvanrahimli)

Co-Founder [@specterise](https://specterise.com) and SWE [@bp](https://bp.com)

Although I currently don't have much time to write code just for fun, I was and will be doing so, after graduating from university :) 

[Just for fun. No, really.](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/)

And this blog is my first attempt at making my "own internet", which turned out nicely. I currently have self hosted:
- Blog: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- Note-taking app: [MoeMemos](https://github.com/mudkipme/MoeMemos)

Planned:
- Nextcloud + OnlyOffice
- Searx as a search aggregator
- On of the ActivityPub implementations
- I'll update this list as I get new ideas

I love autumn, drizzly weather and nature:
