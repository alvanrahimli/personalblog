Although I currently don't have much time to write code just for fun, I was and will be doing so, after graduating from university :) [Just for fun. No, really.](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/)

I recently got to know the term "[Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)", and decided this particular place is my very own digital garden! Apparently blogs are more structured and well written, in the meantime, gardens are just [brain dumps](https://bt.ht/dump). I love this term because it takes that heaviness/responsibility from blogging, and it becomes easier to - well - just put something out there!

This place is my first attempt at making my "own Internet", which turned out nicely. 

De-Google your life!
