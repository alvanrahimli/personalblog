# Welcome to my ~~blog~~ digital garden!

Hi there! I am Alvan, 21, software engineer and a foss fanboy.

I usually hang out at Mastodon: [@alvanrahimli@noc.social](https://noc.social/@alvanrahimli)

Co-Founder [@specterise](https://specterise.com) and SWE [@bp](https://bp.com)

Although I currently don't have much time to write code just for fun, I was and will be doing so, after graduating from university :)

I recently got to know the term "[Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)", and decided this particular place is my very own digital garden! Apparently blogs are more structured and well written, in the meantime, gardens are just [brain dumps](https://bt.ht/dump). I love this term because it takes that heaviness/responsibility from blogging, and it becomes easier to - well - just put something out there!

This place is my first attempt at making my "own Internet", which turned out nicely. I currently have self hosted:

- Blog: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- News feed: [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) (Aggregates youtube, news websites, blogs etc)
- Note-taking / to-do app: [MoeMemos](https://github.com/mudkipme/MoeMemos)

Planned:
- Nextcloud + OnlyOffice
- Searx as a search aggregator
- On of the ActivityPub implementations
- I'll update this list as I get new ideas
