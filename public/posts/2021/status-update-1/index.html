So, recently I was consooming a bit more articles, from other programmers and designers, and suddenly I thought why I&amp;rsquo;m not writing my own thoughts?

<p>Hi, fellow reader!<br>
So, recently I was consooming a bit more articles, from other programmers and designers, and suddenly I thought why I&rsquo;m not writing my own thoughts? Basically, this is good idea, for example you get a chance to look back and remember things you have done. But I was a bit uhmm, how to say, kinda shy. Suddenly, my friend at <a href="https://themisir.com">themisir.com</a> also said this is a good idea. So, this is me, Alvan, doing it :D</p>
<h1 id="what-was-i-up-to">What was I up to?<a href="#what-was-i-up-to" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Recently my life got a massive DLC and there are some interesting things in it. Let&rsquo;s break that into the pieces.<br>
Basically, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>New remote full-time job</li>
<li>A startup project</li>
<li>Another startup, where I am IT guy in team</li>
<li>Some thoughts for another another startup</li>
<li>University exams</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I have to be so stuck and busy all the time, but I&rsquo;m not LOL. Just today, I have watched 2 animated movies: Wreck it Ralph 2 &amp; Sing (has veery nice musics in it).</p>
<h2 id="full-time-job">Full-time job<a href="#full-time-job" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>That full-time job, is such a pain in a**. No, I&rsquo;m not afraid of tasks or smth. It is a bit complicated :(</p>
<h2 id="a-startup-project">A Startup project<a href="#a-startup-project" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Then we have the first startup. It is a mobile app, built for schools and teacher-student relationships. And actually, it&rsquo;s UI Design is almost complete and I&rsquo;m looking for a mobile developer. You know, in my country, it is not that easy to find one. They are all just coders, coding some e-commerce app over-and-over again. You know, they would do the job, but they need money, and guess what, I don&rsquo;t have that much yet.<br>
Whatever, I&rsquo;m planning of learning flutter myself, but it will take hell a lot of time. Bc I have whole back-end infrastructure on me also Management dashboard, Mobile app, blah blah blah. OK well, we&rsquo;ll see :)</p>
<h2 id="another-startup">Another startup<a href="#another-startup" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Ok, that another one, excites my more that others. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t tell you the details, but that is kinda IoT project of mine. Also the first one.<br>
There are projects which needs a lot of regulation.</p>
<h3 id="ill-be-right-back-tomorrow-i-hope"><em>I&rsquo;ll be right back tomorrow (I hope)</em><a href="#ill-be-right-back-tomorrow-i-hope" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
