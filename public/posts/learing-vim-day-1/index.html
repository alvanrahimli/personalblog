<p>Well, to be honest I dont know exact answer, but I&rsquo;ve some stories I tell myself.
First, this is because of the will of efficient use of keyboard. You know, I paid full price for all keys on it. Why shouldn&rsquo;t use them?<br>
The second reason is, wrist healty. As I&rsquo;m planning coding as the main part of my life, of course, it shouldn&rsquo;t hurt me.<br>
At last, the true reason, of course, is +70% coolness. Not using mouse while coding, such a badass behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="first-steps">First steps<a href="#first-steps" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I began with installing Vim on my linux machine. Which is Manjaro (previously it was Fedora). Although Vi was already installed, I don&rsquo;t know difference, so I installed Vim, which stands for Vi IMproved.<br>
2 or 3 days passed, I didn&rsquo;t have enough courage and time to begin. Then I realised, I can do what is <em>not</em> called The Soft-Transition. So, I installed Vim extension for Visual Studio Code. While installing I came accross with Tutor extension, with great UI and explanation. Such a niice extension it is. I went through first 5 tutorials. (It adds new tab to activity bar. You can continue learning any time, very easily)<br>
Currently, I know enough shortcuts and theory to use Vim for daily use, but it is not as fluent as traditional writing of mine, as I&rsquo;m quite used to using these home, end, fn and etc. Not just these! I can&rsquo;t even Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V now! Can you beileve it?? - Of course you do. I said I&rsquo;m learning Vim. Ok, ok, enough cringe, let&rsquo;s go back to topic.</p>
<p><em>Btw, these double spaces in markdown syntax for adding new line, I hate them!</em></p>
<h1 id="getting-used-to-madness">Getting used to madness<a href="#getting-used-to-madness" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>As I was going through those tutorials, I got used to hjkl navigation (I was going through caret labirints, lol!), Then came deleting. U know (or don&rsquo;t know) d at Normal mode. Oh, snap! (not snapcraft.io, I like how easy it is distributing packages with snapd :D)  I didn&rsquo;t tell you about modes. It is not difficult, There are 3 famous modes. <strong>Normal, Insert and Visual</strong>. Basically, in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal mode</strong>: you navigate and manipulate text</li>
<li><strong>Insert mode</strong>: you of course, insert text</li>
<li><strong>Visual mode</strong>: you select text (or maybe as I know)
Okay, it was a bit off-the-rails (are there any phrase like this? let me know :D). Actually, there was some other shortcuts, such as gg, G, H, M, L which I did learn. (they help with navigating file, go to page top, file end and etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pain-or-is-it">Pain (or is it?)<a href="#pain-or-is-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>To understand my pain you don&rsquo;t need to do any extra things. Just know that I started learning Vim. All my instinct-like abilities (copying, pasting, selecting) must be changed. Damn, this is difficult enough to make man insult vim users and quit. But noo, I was linux enthusiast for about 3 years now. If there is one thing I have learnt by far, it is not giving up for every problem I face. My great friend Yalchin reminded this to me yesterday. By the way, he also has <a href="https://yalchin.info/blog">great blog</a>, you can use like handbook. Thanks to him.</p>
