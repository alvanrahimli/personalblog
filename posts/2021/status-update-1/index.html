üí° Introduction Hi, fellow reader!
So, recently I was consooming a bit more articles, from other programmers and designers, and suddenly I thought why I&amp;rsquo;m not writing my own thoughts? Basically, this is good idea, for example you get a chance to look back and remember things you have done.">

<h1 id=-introduction>üí° Introduction<a href=#-introduction class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Hi, fellow reader!<br>
So, recently I was consooming a bit more articles, from other programmers and designers, and suddenly I thought why I&rsquo;m not writing my own thoughts? Basically, this is good idea, for example you get a chance to look back and remember things you have done. But I was a bit uhmm, how to say, kinda shy. Suddenly, my friend at <a href=https://themisir.com>themisir.com</a> also said this is a good idea. So, this is me, Alvan, doing it :D</p>
<h1 id=-what-is-on-my-mind>üí≠ What is on my mind?<a href=#-what-is-on-my-mind class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Recently my life got a massive DLC and some very interesting things in it. Let&rsquo;s break that into the pieces.<br>
Basically, these are what I am (will be) working with on:</p>
<ul>
<li>New remote full-time job</li>
<li>Education oriented startup (w/brother)</li>
<li>IoT oriented startup, where I am IT guy in team</li>
<li>Idea that I&rsquo;m working on</li>
<li>University exams</li>
<li>Whole curiosity of learning new cool stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I have to be so stuck and busy all the time, but I&rsquo;m not LOL. Just today, I have watched 2 animated movies: Wreck it Ralph 2 & Sing (has veery nice musics in it).</p>
<h2 id=full-time-job>Full-time job<a href=#full-time-job class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>That full-time job, is such a pain in a**. No, I&rsquo;m not afraid of tasks or smth. It is a bit complicated :(</p>
<h2 id=education-oriented-startup>Education oriented startup<a href=#education-oriented-startup class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Then we have the first startup. It is a mobile app, built for schools and teacher-student relationships. And actually, it&rsquo;s UI Design is almost complete and I&rsquo;m looking for a mobile developer. You know, in my country, it is not that easy to find one. They are all just coders, coding some e-commerce app over-and-over again. You know, they would do the job, but they need money, and guess what, I don&rsquo;t have that much yet.<br>
Whatever, I&rsquo;m planning of learning flutter myself, but it will take hell a lot of time. Bc I have whole back-end infrastructure on me also Management dashboard, Mobile app, blah blah blah. OK well, we&rsquo;ll see :)</p>
<h2 id=iot-oriented-startup>IoT oriented startup<a href=#iot-oriented-startup class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Ok, that another one, excites my more that others. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t tell you the details, but that is kinda IoT project of mine. Also the first one.<br>
There are projects which needs a lot of regulation.</p>
<h2 id=idea-that-im-working-on>Idea that I&rsquo;m working on<a href=#idea-that-im-working-on class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Oh, this project is a bit interesting and requires attention. It will solve a problem for companies and I&rsquo;m thinking of selling this as an API. But still, this is on very early stage but I have a plan, that hopefully I&rsquo;ll follow. Will be writing more on this as project continues.</p>
<h2 id=learning-new-things>Learning new things<a href=#learning-new-things class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>For now, I want to learn more about Go.</p>
<h1 id=-what-i-actually-did-this-week>üë∑ What I actually did this week?<a href=#-what-i-actually-did-this-week class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>So, interesting question this is. Let&rsquo;s look at the GitHub activity heatmap:</p>
<p><img src=/images/status-update-1/github-activity-14-11-2021.png alt="GitHub Activity" title="Github Activity">
<br>
As you can see, last week was a bit non-coding week. Am I happy? Absolutely no! Do I feel guilty? Indeed, yes! Then why the f* I&rsquo;m not doing any work? Well, this is all because of that full-time job. I&rsquo;m drowning in large codebase with no onboarding or whatsoever. I try to understand and use it, but it is slow. Okay, whatever, I&rsquo;ll handle all of these.</p>
<p>Guess what is interesting! UI Design of our startup! I damn like that. This is exactly what makes me excited to work. And I&rsquo;m looking forward to write posts about that project&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>Okay, these was excuses of my laziness. I couldn&rsquo;t find exact things that I did this week. But next week won&rsquo;t be like this, I hope :D</p>
<h1 id=-what-im-going-to-do-next-week>üéØ What I&rsquo;m going to do next week?<a href=#-what-im-going-to-do-next-week class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h1>
<ul>
<li>Do enough research and a bit coding to make first working example of that <a href=#idea-that-im-working-on>idea</a></li>
<li>Decide who will work on mobile version of our <a href=#a-startup-project>startup</a></li>
<li>Write actual code for this <a href=#a-startup-project>startup</a></li>
<li>Wait for other elements to continue working on this <a href=#another-startup>project</a></li>
<li>Watch some Disney movies (Idk what are these called. Pixar movies? just movies? Whatever.)</li>
</ul>
